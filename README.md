# Fes4channels

Fes4channels is an open access project, developed at the Edmond and Lily Safra International Institute of Neuroscience. The software presented in this repository is intended for the closed-loop control of functional electrostimulation hardware, with inertial sensor feedback, the description of the use of the software and hardware are described below.


## Hardware Description

### Modules and Connections 

To develop electrostimulation hardware, it is necessary a module to increase voltage (Boost), a module to manipulate the signal (H-bridge) and a module for data processing.
